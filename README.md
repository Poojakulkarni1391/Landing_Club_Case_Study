## Conclusions

Lending club company should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan default.

Grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A).

Lending Club should control their number of loan issues to borrowers who are from CA, FL and NY to make profits.

Small business loans are defaulted more. Lending club should stop/reduce issuing the loans to them.

Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved loans. Lending club should stop giving loans to this category when loan amount requested is more than 12000.

When employment length is 10yrs and loan amount is 12k-14k, defaulters are expected more.
